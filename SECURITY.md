# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently as there are no fully working versions Reflow should not be treated as ready for production, while I strive to make sure there are no security vulnerabilities there may be ones that I am unaware of. 
This will be updated when there is a 1.0 release

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability then either make an issue or ping me on discord, `PS1 Hagrid#9064` is my username
