# Reflow

A replacement for the somewhat aged [TechnicSolder](https://github.com/TechnicPack/TechnicSolder) server written in golang

## Status

As of now (June 2021) it can connect to a database and query mods correctly and reports an api in the same way as the official server does.

## Installation

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Zaprit/Reflow/wiki) for details
