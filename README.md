A replacement for the somewhat aged [TechnicSolder](https://github.com/TechnicPack/TechnicSolder) server written in golang

## Status

As of now (September 2021) it can connect to a database and query mods correctly and reports an api in the same way as the official server does.

Occasionally I'll stream development on [my Twitch](https://twitch.tv/zaprit), or it might be games, who knows.
## Installation

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Zaprit/Reflow/wiki) for details

tl;dr you can just download a release from the right and run that, edit the config, and you're off to the races
## Supporting development

You can either directly contribute by sending patches, developing new features, or helping me out when I am smooth brained. Or if you'd like to financially support me then I've got a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/zaprit).
